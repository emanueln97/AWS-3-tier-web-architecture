ðŸš€ Project Drop: AWS 3â€‘Tier Web Architecture (My First Realâ€‘World Build)

I just completed a productionâ€‘style 3â€‘tier web app on AWS with:
â€¢ Internetâ€‘facing ALB â†’ Internal ALB â†’ EC2 Auto Scaling (app tier)
â€¢ Private DB subnets with Amazon RDS/Aurora
â€¢ Segmented Security Groups + leastâ€‘privilege IAM
â€¢ NAT for controlled outbound from private subnets
â€¢ Multiâ€‘AZ subnets & health checks for resilience

What I learned:
â€¢ Designing clean VPC/subnet boundaries and route tables
â€¢ Getting ALB/target groups + ASG health checks working smoothly
â€¢ Hardening access between tiers (only whatâ€™s needed, nothing more)
â€¢ Validating DB connectivity from app tier only

If youâ€™re exploring AWS architecture or hiring for cloud roles, Iâ€™d love your feedback and suggestions!
